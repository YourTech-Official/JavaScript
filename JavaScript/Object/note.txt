JavaScript 'this' Context - Method Calling

The Problem:
When you extract a method from an object and call it without the object context, 'this' loses its reference to the original object.

Method 1: Direct Call (✅ Works)
company.calculateTotalSalary()
- Calls method directly on object
- 'this' = company object
- Works correctly

Method 2: Extracted Call (❌ Breaks)
const func = company.calculateTotalSalary;
func()
- Extracts method from object first
- Calls without object context
- 'this' = undefined
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined"

Solution: Use .call() to restore context
data.call(company)
- Tells the function which object 'this' should be
- 'this' = company object again
- Works correctly

Simple Analogy:
Method 1: Person introduces themselves → "Hi, I'm John" ✅
Method 2: Take away their memory, ask to introduce → "Hi, I'm... who am I?" ❌

Key Point: The difference is CONTEXT - Method 1 keeps it, Method 2 loses it.

Code Example 1: Without Object Context (❌ Breaks)
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function() {
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
  }
};

const func = person.greet;  // Extract method
func();  // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
// Because 'this' = undefined

Code Example 2: With Object Context (✅ Works)
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function() {
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
  }
};

// Method 1: Direct call
person.greet();  // "Hello, I'm John" ✅

// Method 2: Using .call() to restore context
const func = person.greet;
func.call(person);  // "Hello, I'm John" ✅
// Because 'this' = person object
