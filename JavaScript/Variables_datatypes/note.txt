Q1.What is a variable?
Ans - A variable is a named storage location that holds a reference to data in memory.

ex - Think of a variable like a labeled box where you can store and retrieve data.

VARIABLE DECLARATIONS IN JS - 

var - can be re-declared and updated. Has function scope (or global if declared outside function).
      (syntax - var a, var b etc.)

let - cannot be re-declared but can be updated. Has block scope.
      (syntax - let a, let b)

const - cannot be re-declared or updated. Has block scope. Must be initialized at declaration.
        (syntax - const a = value) 

NOTE - 
       JavaScript is dynamically typed - variable types are determined by their values.
       Example: var x = 10; (number type), var x = "10.5"; (string type)
       The value itself determines the data type, not the variable declaration.
       To check variable type use: typeof(x)

DATATYPES IN JS - 

PRIMITIVE TYPES:
1. Number - integers and decimals (ex: 42, 3.14)
2. String - text data (ex: "hello", 'world')
3. Boolean - true or false
4. Undefined - variable declared but not assigned
5. Null - intentional absence of value
6. Symbol - unique identifier (ES6)
7. BigInt - large integers (ES2020)

NON-PRIMITIVE TYPES:
1. Object - collections of key-value pairs (ex: {name: "John"})
2. Array - ordered list of values (ex: [1, 2, 3])
3. Function - reusable code blocks
