Operators in programming are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values.
They are fundamental for tasks like arithmetic, comparison, assignment, and logical operations.

Common types of operators in JavaScript:
1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
2. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
3. Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
4. Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
5. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
6. Ternary Operator: condition ? expr1 : expr2

Example:
let a = 5;
let b = 2;
let sum = a + b; // '+' is an arithmetic operator
let isEqual = (a == b); // '==' is a comparison operator
